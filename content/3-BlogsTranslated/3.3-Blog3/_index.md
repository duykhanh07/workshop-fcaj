# Announcing Amazon Quick Suite: your agentic teammate for answering questions and taking action

Today, we’re announcing [Amazon Quick Suite](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksuite/), a new agentic teammate that quickly answers your questions at work and turns those insights into actions for you. Instead of switching between multiple applications to gather data, find important signals and trends, and complete manual tasks, Quick Suite brings AI-powered research, business intelligence, and automation capabilities into a single workspace. You can now analyze data through natural language queries, find critical information across enterprise and external sources in minutes, and automate processes from simple tasks to complex multi-department workflows.

Here’s a look into Quick Suite.

![Image of Quick Suite](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/10/01/2025_quick-suite_1.png)

Business users often need to gather data across multiple applications—pulling customer details, checking performance metrics, reviewing internal product information, and performing competitive intelligence. This fragmented process often requires consultation with specialized teams to analyze advanced datasets, and in some cases, must be repeated regularly, reducing efficiency and leading to incomplete insights for decision-making.

Quick Suite helps you overcome these challenges by combining agentic teammates for research, business intelligence, and automation into a unified digital workspace for your day-to-day work.

## Quick Index: Your unified knowledge foundation

Quick Index creates a secure, searchable repository that consolidates documents, files, and application data to power AI-driven insights and responses across your organization.

As a foundational component of Quick Suite, Quick Index operates in the background to bring together all your data—from databases and data warehouses to documents and email. This creates a single, intelligent knowledge base that makes AI responses more accurate and reduces time spent searching for information.

Quick Index automatically indexes and prepares any uploaded files or unstructured data you add to your Quick Suite, enabling efficient searching, sorting, and data access. For example, when you search for a specific project update, Quick Index instantly returns results from uploaded documents, meeting notes, project files, and reference materials—all from one unified search instead of checking different repositories and file systems.

## Quick Research: From complex business challenges to expert-level insights

Quick Research is a powerful agent that conducts comprehensive research across your enterprise data and external sources to deliver contextualized, actionable insights in minutes or hours — work that previously could take longer.

Quick Research systematically breaks down complex questions into organized research plans. Starting with a simple prompt, it automatically creates detailed research frameworks that outline the approach and data sources needed for comprehensive analysis.

![quick-suite_research_1-2.png](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/10/07/2025_quick-suite_research_1-2.png)

After Quick Research creates the plan, you can easily refine it through natural language conversations. When you are happy with the plan, it works in the background to gather information from multiple sources, using advanced reasoning to validate findings and provide thorough analysis with citations.

![quick-suite_research_1-3-1.png](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/10/07/2025_quick-suite_research_1-3-1.png)

Quick Research integrates with your enterprise data connected to Quick Suite, the unified knowledge foundation that connects to your dashboards, documents, databases, and external sources, including Amazon S3, Snowflake, Google Drive, and Microsoft SharePoint. Quick Research grounds key insights to original sources and reveals clear reasoning paths, helping you verify accuracy, understand the logic behind recommendations, and present findings with confidence. You can trace findings back to their original sources and validate conclusions through source citations. This makes it ideal for complex topics requiring in-depth analysis.

## Quick Flows: Automation for everyone

With Quick Flows, any user can automate repetitive tasks by describing their workflow using natural language without requiring any technical knowledge. Quick Flows fetches information from internal and external sources, takes action in business applications, generates content, and handles process-specific requirements.

![quick-suite_flows_3.png](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/10/02/2025_quick-suite_flows_3.png)

Starting with straightforward business requirements, it creates a multi-step flow including input steps for gathering information, reasoning groups for AI-powered processing, and output steps for generating and presenting results.

![quick-suite_flows_4.png](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/10/02/2025_quick-suite_flows_4.png)

After the flow is configured, you can share it with a single click to your coworkers and other teams. To execute the flow, users can open it from the library or invoke it from chat, provide the necessary inputs, and then chat with the agent to refine the outputs and further customize the results.

## Quick Automate: Enterprise-scale process automation

Quick Automate helps technical teams build and deploy sophisticated automation for complex, multistep processes that span departments, systems, and third-party integrations. Using AI-powered natural language processing, Quick Automate transforms complex business processes into multi-agent workflows that can be created merely by describing what you want to automate or uploading process documentation.

![quick-suite_automate_1.png](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/10/02/2025_quick-suite_automate_1.png)

While Quick Flows handles straightforward workflows, Quick Automate is designed for comprehensive and complex business processes like customer onboarding, procurement automations, or compliance procedures that involve multiple approval steps, system integrations, and cross-departmental coordination. Quick Automate offers advanced orchestration capabilities with extensive monitoring, debugging, versioning, and deployment features.

![quick-suite_automate_4.png](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/10/02/2025_quick-suite_automate_4.png)

Quick Automate then generates a comprehensive automation plan with detailed steps and actions. You will find a UI agent that understands natural language instructions to autonomously navigate websites, complete form inputs, extract data, and produces structured outputs for downstream automation steps.

Additionally, you can define a custom agent, complete with instructions, knowledge, and tools, to complete process-specific tasks using the visual building experience – no code required.

![quicksuite_quickautomate-1-1.gif](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/10/09/2025_quicksuite_quickautomate-1-1.gif)

## Additional foundational capabilities
Quick Suite includes other foundational capabilities that deliver seamless data organization and contextual AI interactions across your enterprise.

**Spaces** – Spaces provide a straightforward way for every business user to add their own context by uploading files or connecting to specific datasets and repositories specific to their work or to a particular function. For example, you might create a space for quarterly planning that includes budget spreadsheets, market research reports, and strategic planning documents. Or you could set up a product launch space that connects to your project management system and customer feedback databases. Spaces can scale from personal use to enterprise-wide deployment while maintaining access permissions and seamless integration with Quick Suite capabilities.
