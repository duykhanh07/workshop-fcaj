### Week 10 Achievements:
* Learn DynamoDB from basic to advanced: create tables, load sample data, CRUD via CLI/Console, Query/Scan, Transactions, Item Collections, and Global Secondary Index.
* Deploy full DynamoDB backup mechanisms: PITR, backup on-demand, scheduled backup, and restrict backup deletion.
* Apply advanced design patterns: Capacity Units, Partitioning, Sequential/Parallel Scan, Write Sharding, handle overloaded GSI, Sparse Index, Composite Keys, and Adjacency Lists.
* Integrate DynamoDB Streams with Lambda to replicate data to replica table; configure IAM; create trigger and verify replication.
* Build Serverless & Event-Driven architecture: Global Tables, Globalflix lab, StateLambda → MapLambda → ReduceLambda pipeline with idempotency and deduplication; Zero-ETL DynamoDB – OpenSearch – Bedrock.
* Optimize AWS costs: Savings Plan, RI, Rightsizing, Compute Optimizer, Cost Explorer, analyze Data Transfer Out, Glue + Athena for advanced cost queries.
* Deploy TravelBuddy: set up environment, deploy Elastic Beanstalk, update, connect CI/CD (CodeStar → CodeCommit → CodeDeploy), push Windows Service, and monitor service.
