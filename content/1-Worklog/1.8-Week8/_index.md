### Week 8 Achievements:
* Centrally manage users using IAM Identity Center: set up environment, create user/group, update permissions, and perform audit operations via API.
* Enhance access control using Permission Boundary and Role Condition: limit user permissions, limit switch role by time/IP, and test actual permission delegation.
* Deploy application layer security solutions: enable Security Hub, assess according to security standards; deploy AWS WAF with managed rules, custom rules, JSON rule logic, and log requests.
* Manage encryption, monitor, and analyze logs: create KMS key, configure CloudTrail, upload S3 data, query logs using Athena, and test encrypted data sharing.
* Set up system backup process with AWS Backup: create backup plan, configure backup resources, combine with SNS to send notifications, and check backup results.
