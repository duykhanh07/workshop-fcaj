### Week 9 Objectives:
* Understand and practice connecting multiple VPCs using VPC Peering and Transit Gateway.
* Grasp the container application deployment process: build, push image to Amazon ECR, run with Docker, Docker Compose, and deploy using Amazon ECS.
* Get familiar with CI/CD systems using GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline.
* Manage and automate application deployment with CodeCommit – CodeDeploy – CodePipeline, combined with CloudWatch Events.
* Learn about and configure AWS Storage Gateway and Windows Multi-AZ storage platform (file system, file share, performance, quota, deduplication).
